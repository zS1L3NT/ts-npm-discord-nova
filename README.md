Nova Bot is a Discord Bot framework built mainly to make it easier for me to maintain all my discord bots. It provides very limited flexibility but allows building powerful and bug-free Discord bots very quickly.

## Motivation

I built this Discord Framework because when I built many different Discord bots, I used the same template code across all the frameworks, and it became difficult tracking which bots have the latest changes to the template. So I decided to make this a framework so that I could maintain all my bots with much more ease.

## Features

-   Cache guild information in Firebase so that guild data doesn't reset everytime the bot is redeployed
-   Nova will read each command dynamically according to the filenames for each command.
    -   If you have a file `/slashs/play`, Nova will register a `/play` slash command and use the data in the file as the metadata and callback of the slash command
    -   Same works with
        -   `/buttons` for button interactions
        -   `/selectmenus` for select menu interactions
        -   `/messages` for message commands
        -   `/events` for discord events
-   A Bot-wide and Guild-wide caching system to store information about the Bot and individual Guilds.
-   Dynamic help command builder which reads from the `/slashs` and `/messages` folders to find out all the available commands to interact with the bot
-   Allow bot to constantly clean messages in one channel to make sure it is the only one with messages in the channel. This is useful for
    -   Music Queues as the only message in the channel
    -   Calendar bots to only show calendar related messages sent by the bot in the channel
-   Allows custom logging of events happening like
    -   Initialization of the bot
    -   Alerts, Warnings and Errors in the code
    -   A slash command being used
    -   A button interaction being used
    -   A select menu interaction being used
    -   A message command being used

## Usage

I don't intend to write any documentation for this framework since the framework was build primarily for my use, and not for public use.
